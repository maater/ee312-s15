	  Course Overview:
	</td>
	<td>
	This is the first course in computing for students of computer engineering and electrical engineering. The objective is to provide a strong foundation that a serious student can build on in later courses across the spectrum of computer science and engineering.  The idea is that a more complete understanding of the fundamentals early in your education will help you acquire a deeper understanding of more advanced topics later, whether that topic is in computer architecture, operating systems, data base, networks, algorithm design, software engineering, or whatever.  I call the approach "motivated" bottom-up.  That is, after providing some overview of why a new concept is important, we attempt to tie that new concept to what you already understand. Starting with the transistor as a switch, we build logic gates, then more complex logic structures, then gated latches, culminating in an implementation of memory and a finite state machine.  From there, we study the computer's instruction cycle, and then a particular computer, the LC-3 (for Little Computer 3).  Why "3"? ...because we got it wrong the first couple of times! The LC-3 captures the important structures of a modern computer, while keeping it simple enough to allow complete understanding.  The first programming assignment is in the machine language of the LC-3.  From there, we move up to Assembly Language, and learn how an assembler works. The remaining programming assignments are in LC-3 Assembly Language.  We cover good programming style and practice, and teach debugging from the gitgo. An LC-3 Simulator allows the student to debug his/her own programs.  Input (via the keyboard) and output (via the monitor) both use physical device registers.  System service routines, written in
 LC-3 Assembly Language are used to perform I/O functions. They are invoked by user programs by the TRAP instruction and corresponding trap vector. Subroutine calls and returns complete the LC-3 instruction set.

	  Prerequisites: 
	</td>
	<td>
	There are no computer pre-requisites. No programming experience is assumed.  On the other hand, we do assume that the student is able and highly motivated to learn and has the energy and intelligence to support that motivation.  We also assume that your mathematics background is at least at the level where you are enrolled in a strong calculus sequence. EE 306 is intended for freshmen, but is open to all students who want a serious introduction to computing in general and computer engineering in particular.
	<br>
	<br>
If you are one of those with no experience using computers, please do not be intimidated by those in the classroom with years of computer experience. It has been the case many times that students with no computer experience earn A in the course, and students with lots of experience earn C or lower.

	  Homework Policy:
	</td>
	<td>
	 Problem sets will be assigned periodically. Usually, students will have between one and two weeks to complete them. Students are encouraged to form study groups to work homework problems. Only one copy of a problem set per group need be turned in. There will be five programming assignments, one in machine language, four in assembly language. Dates and times when problem sets and programming assignments are due are contained on the Course Outline. Students are encouraged to discuss the structure of the program with other members of their group. However, the detailed algorithm and actual coding must be done by the student working alone. Collaboration on the algorithm and/or giving or accepting actual code for a program constitutes cheating, and will be dealt with harshly. <b>Please see the handout: Additional introductory comments about EE 306 for more information on what constitutes cheating.</b> <br>

	  Quiz and Exam Policy:

	<td>
	There will be two exams in class, one on October XXX, the other on November XXX. There will be a final exam during the normal final exam period. Our preliminary information has the Final Exam scheduled for December XXX from XXX to XXX. However, the university sometimes changes the dates of some final exams, so it is important to check the final exam schedule when it is formally posted. All exams will be closed book, with two exceptions: (1) The student may bring into the exam three sheets of paper on which the student is free to write anything he/she wishes. All three sheets must be original sheets in the student's own handwriting. (2) The student may bring into the exam any handouts that have been expressly permitted by the instructor prior to the exam.  The student may not have in his possession during any exam a calculator, a mobile phone, or any other mechanism that in the view of the instructor can distract from a fair and balanced examination
